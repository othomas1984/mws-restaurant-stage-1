# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course
## Installation and Usage

Make sure you have a server running on `localhost:1337` which will serve up the proper restaurant data. See [repo for part III](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) of the course.

Make sure all dependancies are installed properly:

```npm install```

Then use gulp to run this project locally:

```gulp serve```

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
